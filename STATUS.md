# Roast — status snapshot

Written 2026-08-28, updated 2026-08-29, as a durable checkpoint in case a session
gets lost. See `CLAUDE.md` for conventions (package root, Netty decision, test
stack) and `../DESIGN.md` for the full protocol design/phase plan this follows
(module name predates "Roast" — it says `srt-core` there; also see its
"Extensibility & observability" section, added 2026-08-29 — read that before
touching the connection layer's public API again).

## Where we are

**Phase 2 (handshake) is essentially done** per DESIGN.md §5's phased plan and its
own stated definition of done: a real SRT peer reaches "connected" against
`SrtListener`. Confirmed 2026-08-29 against real **libsrt 1.5.7**
(`srt-live-transmit`, built from source at `roast/references/srt`) — induction,
cookie verification, StreamID/extension parsing, TSBPD negotiation, and the
accept/`onConnection` hooks all checked out correctly against an independent
implementation, not just our own code. This is `LibsrtInteropTest`
(`@Tag("interop")`, run via `./gradlew interopTest`), not the default `test` task
— see "Architecture decisions" below for why. Phase 1 (packet codec) is
functionally done for what's needed so far.

**Not yet tried:** `ffmpeg`'s own `srt://` muxer specifically (only libsrt's own
`srt-live-transmit` tool) — ffmpeg wraps the same libsrt handshake code, so this
is expected to work, but hasn't been literally exercised. Everything else is
still verified only against gosrt's golden vectors and our own round-trip tests.

84 tests passing (83 default + 1 interop, gated separately), all committed to
`main` (no branches). Every commit so far has been asked-for explicitly by the
user, one narrowly-scoped piece at a time — see git log for the exact sequence
and rationale (commit messages are detailed).

## What's built

**`packet`** — the 16-byte common header (F-bit, data-packet fields, control-type
dispatch), as a sealed `SrtPacket` (`DataPacket`/`ControlPacket`), decode/encode
against a Netty `ByteBuf`. `SrtSocketId` value type. `ControlType` enum (all 9 SRT
control types). CIF bodies are carried as an opaque `ByteBuf` — this layer only
frames the fixed header.

**`packet.cif`** — parses two specific CIFs:
- `LossListCodec`/`LossRange` — NAK loss list (single/range sequence-number
  encoding), verified byte-for-byte against gosrt's `CIFNAK` golden vector.
- `HandshakeCif` (+ `HandshakeType`, `HandshakeExtension`,
  `HandshakeExtensionFlags`, `ExtensionType`, `RejectionReason`, `PeerAddressCodec`)
  — the 48-byte handshake base structure, plus HSREQ/HSRSP and SID extension TLVs.
  KMREQ/KMRSP (encryption) and Congestion Control extensions are recognized but
  skipped by declared length, not parsed. Verified against gosrt's
  `TestHandshakeV4`/`V5` golden vectors (with the KM/Congestion portions of V5
  stripped out, since those aren't parsed).
  `handshakeTypeCode` is a raw int, not a closed enum — any value outside the 5
  known progression types is a legitimate rejection-reason code, not malformed
  data (see `HandshakeCif.isRejection()`/`rejectionReason()`).

**`codec`** — `SrtFrameDecoder`/`SrtFrameEncoder`, Netty
`MessageToMessage(De|En)coder`s bridging `DatagramPacket` ↔ `SrtPacket`, preserving
sender/recipient via `AddressedEnvelope`. Malformed/undersized datagrams are
dropped, never thrown.

**`socket`** — the connection layer:
- `SrtSocketIdDemultiplexer` — routes inbound packets by destination socket ID to
  a registered `SrtPacketSink`; socket ID `0` routes to a separate "acceptor" sink.
- `SrtSocketIdGenerator` — random 32-bit socket ID allocation with collision retry
  and release-for-reuse.
- `SrtListener` — binds a real Netty `NioDatagramChannel` (pipeline:
  `SrtFrameDecoder` → `SrtFrameEncoder` → `SrtSocketIdDemultiplexer`) and drives
  `ListenerHandshake` through it. Writes replies by holding the bound `Channel`
  directly (`SrtPacketSink.onPacket` doesn't carry a `ChannelHandlerContext`, so
  changing that shipped interface wasn't worth it for this). Dedupes retried
  CONCLUSIONs (keyed by the peer's advertised socket ID) by resending a cached
  accept response rather than re-running accept logic — more robust than gosrt's
  silent-drop, since it recovers if our own first reply was lost. **Registers no
  per-connection data sink** — a DATA packet for an accepted connection is logged
  and dropped by the demux's existing unknown-socket-id path, which is *correct*
  Phase 2 behavior (DESIGN.md: "connects... then fails gracefully at data stage"),
  not a bug to chase.
- `ConnectionRequest` / `AcceptDecision` / `AcceptHandler` / `AcceptedConnection`
  — the extensibility surface added per DESIGN.md's "Extensibility &
  observability" section: rich accept/reject (peer address, StreamID, SRT
  version, requested latency, encryption flag) and a connection-lifecycle hook,
  not just a bare accept/reject boolean. `AcceptedConnection` is connection
  *metadata* only — no read/write surface exists yet (needs Phase 3).

**`util`** — `CircularNumber`: wrap-aware comparator/arithmetic for 31-bit sequence
numbers and 32-bit timestamps (SRT wraps these on the wire), ported from gosrt's
`circular.Number`.

**`handshake`** — `SynCookie`: MD5-based SYN cookie so a listener can verify an
INDUCTION cookie was echoed back correctly in CONCLUSION without keeping
per-attempt state, verified against gosrt's golden vector.
`ListenerHandshake` (+ `ConclusionOutcome`): the listener side of the
induction→conclusion exchange as **pure decision logic** — given a decoded
`HandshakeCif`, produces the `HandshakeCif` to send back. No socket I/O itself;
`SrtListener` is what actually calls it over a live channel.

**`harness`** (test-only) — `UdpLossProxy`: standalone UDP relay that randomly
drops packets in both directions, for exercising ARQ without OS-level netem.

**`interop`** (test-only) — `LibsrtInteropTest`: binds `SrtListener`, launches the
real `srt-live-transmit` binary as a subprocess against it, asserts on both sides
independently (our hooks fire with correct fields, *and* the peer's own stdout
confirms `"SRT target connected"`). Skips itself via `Assumptions` (build stays
green) if the binary isn't found — checks `$SRT_LIVE_TRANSMIT` env var first,
falls back to `references/srt/build/srt-live-transmit`.

## Architecture decisions in force

- Package root `org.brewstream.roast` (Gradle group `org.brewstream`), not
  `io.github.brewstream` — renamed early on.
- Transport is built on **Netty** (4.2.17.Final), not raw NIO — an explicit
  engineering call, not DESIGN.md's original "Option A vs B" (that section of
  DESIGN.md has since been reworded from an open choice to stating the decision).
  Netty 4.2 deprecates `NioEventLoopGroup` in favor of
  `new MultiThreadIoEventLoopGroup(NioIoHandler.newFactory())` — `SrtListener`
  uses the modern form; watch for this if adding more Netty bootstrap code.
- DESIGN.md's **"Extensibility & observability"** section (§4, added 2026-08-29)
  is now a first-class design constraint on the connection layer, not a Phase 6
  afterthought — this is BrewStream's actual value proposition over a libsrt
  binding (see the connection request/lifecycle hooks above). Read it before
  changing `SrtListener`'s public API or designing the Phase 3 data path's hooks.
- Tests: JUnit 5 + **AssertJ** for assertions (not `Assertions.assertEquals` etc.)
  + **Mockito** for collaborator mocks. `SrtListenerTest` and `LibsrtInteropTest`
  are the exceptions to "plain synchronous assertions" — real socket I/O (and, for
  the latter, a real subprocess) on async threads, so callback/output assertions
  go through a `CompletableFuture` / a joined reader thread.
- **Interop tests are gated separately.** `build.gradle`'s default `test` task
  excludes `@Tag("interop")`; a dedicated `interopTest` task runs those. Don't add
  a test that spawns an external process or depends on a locally-built binary to
  the default `test` task — tag it `interop` instead, and make it skip via
  `Assumptions` (not fail) when its prerequisite isn't present.
- Reference implementations cloned locally at `roast/references/` (gitignored,
  never pushed): `gosrt` (Go, MIT — the primary structural/golden-vector
  reference), `srt-rfc` (Haivision's actively-maintained spec source, supersedes
  the expired 2021 IETF `draft-sharabayko-srt-01` datatracker snapshot — SRT
  never became a formal RFC), and `srt` (Haivision's libsrt, MPL-2.0 — built from
  source, `cmake -DENABLE_APPS=ON .. && make` in `references/srt/build/`, gives
  `srt-live-transmit` for interop testing; needs OpenSSL and a C++ toolchain,
  both present via Homebrew on this machine).
- `SrtPacket.encodeTo`/CIF `encodeTo` methods **consume and release** their
  `ByteBuf` body — a packet that needs sending again (ARQ retransmit) must
  `retainedDuplicate()` into a fresh packet first, not reuse an encoded one.

## Known gaps / deliberately deferred

- **MSS/payload-size negotiation** when a peer advertises a smaller MTU than
  ours, and **Congestion Control extension** parsing/mismatch rejection — both
  skipped in `ListenerHandshake` for lack of a config object; noted inline there.
- **No `SrtConfig`** — `SrtListener` hardcodes 120ms latency (both directions)
  and SRT version `0x010401` (matching gosrt's own baseline).
- **Encryption** (KMREQ/KMRSP, PBKDF2, AES-CTR) — Phase 5 in DESIGN.md, untouched.
- **Caller-side handshake** (dial/connect flow) — only the listener side exists.
- **ARQ, TSBPD/jitter buffering, TLPKTDROP, ACK/ACKACK, the actual data path** —
  Phase 3, untouched beyond the NAK loss-list wire codec. This is why an accepted
  connection can't yet send/receive anything.

## Next steps, in order

1. *(Optional, low-priority)* Try `ffmpeg --enable-libsrt`'s own `srt://` muxer
   against `SrtListener`, for full belt-and-suspenders confidence beyond
   `srt-live-transmit` — not expected to surface anything new, since ffmpeg
   wraps the same libsrt handshake code already exercised.
2. **Phase 3 receiver path** — receive buffer, NAK generation using the
   loss-list codec, ACK/ACKACK, TSBPD delivery, KEEPALIVE, SHUTDOWN. This is
   what actually lets an accepted connection send/receive data — right now it
   can only complete a handshake. Design its event hooks against DESIGN.md's
   "Extensibility & observability" list from the start, not retrofitted after.

## How to pick this back up

Read this file, then `CLAUDE.md`, then skim `git log --oneline` (commit messages
carry real rationale, not just "what changed"). `DESIGN.md` at the workspace root
still governs overall phase order and protocol references, including the
extensibility/hooks design constraint added 2026-08-29 — it predates this
implementation work in its original form, but has been actively edited alongside
it since, so treat it as current, not frozen.
